# Capstone Project 2024
A project by: Nils Brun

# About the Project

This project is carried out as part of the Data Mining seminar. The aim is to answer the following research question:
Is the coverage of the conflict in gaza by SRF biased towards the israeli side?

with the following hypothesis:
1. The media coverage of SRF gives more visibility to the israeli side
2. The media coverage of SRF is negatively slanted towards the palestinian side

This is only done superficially, a more detailed analysis would be valuable.

# Folder Structure
In our repo we got several different folders:
* data: for the raw data files
* data_prep: preprocessing data
* script: data analysis
* figs: for the plots
* report: for the final report
* junk: for files that we didnt want to delete just yet but arent used anymore
